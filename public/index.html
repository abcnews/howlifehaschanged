'Children grow fat while mothers work', the headlines screamed. </p><p>Both parents are now working in the majority of families with kids under 15</p><a name="twoparentswork"> </a><p>But the problem of obesity in kids has got worse, not better, since then.</p><p>One in four 7-15-year-olds are now overweight or obese</p><a name="kidsobese"> </a><a name="classteenagers"> </a><h2>Teenagers</h2><p>Teenagers in the 80s weren't keen on staying at school and reported being 'fed up' with it and wanting their own money.</p><p>Nearly all teenagers now stay at school to Year 12</p><a name="schooltoyrtwelve"> </a><p>The teenagers who have full time jobs now earn more (in 2016 dollars)</p><a name="incometeens"> </a><p>Australia had a 'youths job crisis' in 1981 according to the government, though it's actually harder to find a full-time job now if you are a teenager.</p><p>Unemployment in this group peaked at 34 per cent in 1992.</p><p>There are now also more teens and twenty-somethings 'under-employed', who want more hours work.</p><p>The proportion of unemployed 15-19-year-olds looking for a full time job is higher</p><a name="unemployedteens"> </a><p>Three times more 15-24-year-olds are under-employed</p><a name="underemployed"> </a><p>More worrying for 80s teens was the 'horrific' road accident death rate in their age group, with drink-driving blamed.</p><p>The road accident death rate in 15-25-year-olds is five times lower now</p><a name="roadaccidents"> </a><a name="classtwenties"> </a><h2>People in their 20s</h2><a name="classquotefix">

are married now</p><a name="twentiesmarried"> </a><p>The median marriage age has gone up eight years</p><a name="medianmarriage"> </a><p>Later marrying age, and the cost of housing, means more twenty-somethings live at home now.</p><p>One in three 18-34-year-olds live with their parents now</p><a name="livingwithparents"> </a><p>The inflation rate was six times higher in 1981 and was blamed for students being 'caught in a poverty slide', and that was without twenty-first century rents to deal with.</p><p>Weekly rent has more than doubled since 1981</p><a name="costofrent">

least a Bachelor's degree</p><a name="highestdegreethirties"> </a><p>The median age of first-time mothers has gone up four years</p><a name="firstchild"> </a><p>Australians in their thirties find it hard to get on the property ladder - the median house price has leapt since 1981.</p><p>But affordability - mortgage payments as a percentage of household income, peaked at 38 per cent in 1989.</p><p>The median house price is more than twice as high (in 2016 dollars)</p><a name="medianhouseprice"> </a><p>Mortgage repayments as a percent of income are also higher</p><a name="mortgageaffordability"> </a><a name="classforties"> </a><h2>People in their 40s</h2><p>More forty-something women have university educations now and not surprisingly, large families are unusual.</p><p>Six times more 40-44-year-olds have at least a Bachelor's degree</p><a name="bachelorsforties"> </a><p>Few 45-49-year-old women now have four or more children</p><a name="fourchildren"> </a><p>Marriage doesn't mean staying out of the workforce in the twenty-first century, though in 1981 women were warned about 'when that extra pay upsets the marriage'.</p><p>Lots of 45-49-year-old married women didn't work in 1981</p><a name="marriednotworking"> </a><p>'Life is tougher for the average family', said the headlines in 1981.</p><p>Wages were up 75 per cent in six years but rampant inflation meant basic living costs had risen by 100 per cent.</p><p>Households spend $464 more every week (in 2016 dollars)</p><a name="householdspending"> </a><p>Average gross household income per week is $740 more (in 2016 dollars)</p><a name="householdincome"> </a><p>Twenty per cent of household spending now goes to housing, up from 13 per cent in 1984.</p><p>Housing now makes up a fifth of weekly household spending</p><a name="mortgageinterest"> </a><a name="classfifties"> </a><h2>People in their 50s</h2><p>In 1981, the manufacturing industry was the biggest employer of men in their fifties, though it had been declining for a decade.</p><p>Only one in ten 55-59-year-old men now work in manufacturing</p><a name="manufacturing"> </a><p>At least half of all employees used to be in a trade union</p><a name="tradeunion"> </a><p>Australians have cut back on at least some unhealthy habits since the 1980s.</p><p>The proportion of 45-54-year-old men who smoke has halved</p><a name="genxsmokers"> </a><p>Pure alcohol consumption per person per year (litres) has fallen by a third</p><a name="adultdrinking"> </a><p>Healthier living has contributed to a big reduction in heart attacks and strokes around the age of fifty, although Australians were warned in 1985 that anger caused heart attacks.</p><p>The heart attack death rate has fallen 80 per cent in 45-54-year-olds</p><a name="heartattackgenx"> </a><p>The stroke death rate has fallen 70 per cent in 45-54-year-olds</p><a name="strokegenx"> </a><p>But being overweight is now the norm.</p><p>More than three quarters of 45-64-year-olds are now overweight or obese</p><a name="adultobese"> </a><p>In 1984, the government launched an advertising campaign to 'mend marriages'.</p><p>Divorce rates are higher now for over 40s, but lower for younger people.</p><p>Divorce rates are 80 per cent higher for 55-59-year-olds</p><a name="divorceboomers"> </a><a name="classsixties"> </a><h2>People in their 60s</h2><p>It was far easier to earn big money in the 80s armed only with a high school education.</p><p>In 1981, more than half those earning more than $100,000 a year had only a high school education</p><a name="overonehundred"> </a><p>Far more 60-64-year-olds have at least a Bachelor's degree now</p><a name="highestdegreeboomers"> </a><p>In 1985, a NSW court awarded a female sales assistant damages when her employer forced her to retire at 60.</p><p>The pension eligibility age for women began to increase up to 65 from 1995.</p><p>Fewer 65-69-year-olds are retired now</p><a name="boomersretired">

80s.</p><p>The massive reduction in heart attacks has contributed to that.</p><p>Those aged 65 can now expect to live another 20 years</p><a name="lifeexpectancyboomers"> </a><p>The heart attack death rate has fallen 90 per cent in 65-74-year-olds</p><a name="heartattackboomers"> </a><p>A Sydney restaurant introduced 'non-smoking Tuesdays' in 1981 and a survey found 80 per cent wanted smoking
