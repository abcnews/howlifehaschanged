government, though it's actually harder to find a full-time job now if you are a teenager.</p><p>Unemployment in this group peaked at 34 per cent in 1992.</p><p>There are now also more teens and twenty-somethings 'under-employed', who want more hours work.</p><p>The proportion of unemployed 15-19 year-olds looking for a full time job is higher</p><a name="unemployedteens"> </a><p>Three times more 15-24-year-olds are under-employed</p><a name="underemployed"> </a><p>More worrying for 80s teens was the 'horrific' road accident death rate in their age group, with drink-driving blamed.</p><p>The road accident death rate in 15-25-year-olds is five times lower now</p><a name="roadaccidents"> </a><a name="classtwenties"> </a><h2>Twenties</h2><p>'20: too young to get married?'

home now.</p><p>One in three 18-34-year-olds live with their parents now</p><a name="livingwithparents"> </a><p>The inflation rate was six times higher in 1981 and was blamed for students being

living-away-from-home allowance is three times higher now (in 2016 dollars)</p><a name="youthallowance"> </a><p>Since then, the dole has only gone up slightly.</p><p>Singles unemployment benefit is

relationships in 1981</p><a name="defacto"> </a><p>As women have become more educated, they are having children later.</p><p>A quarter of 30-34-year-olds now have at least a Bachelor's degree</p><a name="highestdegreethirties"> </a><p>The median age of first-time mothers has gone up four years</p><a name="firstchild"> </a><p>Australians in their thirties find it hard to get on the property ladder - the median house price has leapt since 1981.</p><p>But affordability - mortgage payments as a percentage of household income, peaked in 1989.</p><p>The median house price is more than twice as high (in 2016 dollars)</p><a name="medianhouseprice"> </a><p>Mortgage repayments as a percent of income are also higher</p><a name="mortgageaffordability"> </a><a name="classforties"> </a><h2>Forties</h2><p>More forty-something women have university educations now and not surprisingly, large families are unusual.</p><p>Six times more 40-44-year-olds have at least a Bachelor's degree</p><a name="bachelorsforties"> </a><p>Few 45-49-year-old women now have four or more children</p><a name="fourchildren"> </a><p>Marriage doesn't mean staying out of the workforce in the twenty-first century, though in 1981 women were warned about 'when that extra pay upsets the marriage'.</p><p>Lots of 45-49-year-old married women didn't work in 1981</p><a name="marriednotworking"> </a><p>'Life is tougher for the average family', said the headlines in 1981.</p><p>Wages were up 75 per cent in six years but rampant inflation meant basic living costs had risen by 100 per cent.</p><p>Households spend $464 more every week (in 2016 dollars)</p><a name="householdspending"> </a><p>Average gross household income per week is $740 more (in 2016 dollars)</p><a name="householdincome"> </a><p>Twenty per cent of household spending now goes to housing, up from 13 per cent in 1984.</p><p>Housing now makes up a third of weekly household spending</p><a name="mortgageinterest"> </a><a name="classfifties"> </a><h2>Fifties</h2><p>In 1981, the manufacturing industry was the biggest employer of men in their fifties, though it had been declining for a decade.</p><p>Only one in ten 55-59-year-old men now work in manufacturing</p><a name="manufacturing"> </a><p>At least half of employees used to be in a trade union</p><a name="tradeunion">

consumption per year has fallen by 30 per cent (litres)</p><a name="adultdrinking"> </a><p>And that has contributed to a big reduction in heart attacks and strokes around the age of fifty, although Australians were warned in 1985 that anger caused heart attacks.</p><p>The heart attack death rate has fallen 80 per cent in per 45-54-year-olds</p><a name="heartattackgenx"> </a><p>The stroke death rate has fallen 70 per cent in per 45-54-year-olds</p><a name="strokegenx"> </a><p>But being overweight is now the norm.</p><p>More than three quarters of 45-64-year-olds are now overweight or

up by about three years</p><a name="retirementaverage"> </a><p>Sixty-five year old's can now expect to live five years longer than retirees in the 80s.</p><p>The massive reduction in heart attacks has contributed to that.</p><p>Now 65-year-olds can expect to live another 20 years</p><a name="lifeexpectancyboomers"> </a><p>The heart attack death rate has fallen 90 per cent in 65-74-year-olds</p><a
